Introduction
============

In todayâ€™s digital world where data is under constant attack, passwords may get compromised through techniques like phishing, keystroke logging and brute force. In such scenarios, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS is an efficient way to verify user access. As every country has its own communication compliance rules and regulations, so implementing 2FA functionality via SMS at a global scale becomes challenging for the developers.

To implement 2FA via SMS on a global scale over Heroku platform successfully, the developer community can use the Heroku 2FA app that uses Nexmo Messaging APIs for user verification. This app can be deployed and integrated easily with any available programming languages for the phone verification and One-time-password (OTP).

Use Case
========

Enable Heroku developer community to implement Two Factor Authentication (2FA) services via SMS using Nexmo messaging APIs, so they can easily deploy and integrate it with any platform (C\#, Java, PHP and etc).

Prerequisites
=============

-   Heroku subscription

-   Nexmo subscription and corresponding Nexmo API keys (Keys and Secret). To access the API keys, see the appendix section.

-   Make sure the provided information in configuration setting (Nexmo Key, Secret, etc.) are correct.

Features 
=========
